! The above "Submission Date" is when the annotation project provided
! this file to the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC).  The "GOC Validation
! Date" indicates when this file was last changed as a result of a GOC
! validation and filtering process.
!
! Note: The contents of this file may differ from that submitted to the
! GOC. The identifiers and syntax of the file have been checked, rows of
! data not meeting the standards set by the GOC have been removed. This
! file may also have annotations removed because the annotations for the
! listed Taxonomy identifier are only allowed in a file provided by
! another annotation project.  The original submitted file is available from:

!The set of protein accessions included in this file is based on UniProt complete proteomes, which may provide more than one protein per gene.
!They include all Swiss-Prot entries for the species plus any TrEMBL entries that have an Ensembl DR line. The TrEMBL entries are likely to overlap with the Swiss-Prot entries or their isoforms.
!If a particular protein accession is not annotated with GO, then it will not appear in this file.
!
!Note that the annotation set in this file is filtered in order to reduce redundancy; the full, unfiltered set can be found in
